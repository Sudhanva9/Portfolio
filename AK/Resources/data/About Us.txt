ADVANCED ACADEMIC CENTER (AAC) at GRIET is a forum which has been in existence for nearly eight years, but mostly serving the interests of 1 B.Tech. students. The activities included training in application software like MATHEMATICA, MATLAB, SPSS and MULTISIM. It is heartening to mention that some of the major projects of B.Tech. were executed at this center between 2005 and 2008 in the disciplines of CSE, IT and ECE. Periodically, senior students across disciplines would consult teaching staff of Mathematics to discuss various methods and techniques required for their study during project work.

In this scenario, it was felt that there should be a facility for any student (UG/PG) or a faculty member to discuss academic issues and/or get his/her data processed for analysis. As a natural corollary, it is proposed to expand the activities of AAC by requesting faculty from GRIET to be consultants in various areas of specialization. The process of identifying resource persons and their domains has already begun and the list should be ready shortly. Among the areas identified so far include Scientific Computation, Digital image processing, Pattern Recognition, Cryptology, Computer Graphics and Signal Processing. New areas can be included depending on the responses from students.
